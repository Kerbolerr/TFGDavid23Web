# Frontend for using price prediction tool
This application aims at providing an easy and intuitive frontend for using the the [data predicion tool](https://github.com/Kerbolerr/TFGDavid23Model).
It has been developed in the context of a bachelor’s thesis for the Computer Engineering degree in FIB (Facultad d'informàtica de Barcelona) from UPC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya).

It provides a frontend for using the application.
The frontend allows to make predictions for desktop, laptops, smartphones and tablets.
It also allows to read device reports generated with e-reuse tools (i.e. Workbench). [Example files](https://github.com/eReuse/devicehub-teal/blob/master/ereuse_devicehub/dummy/files/asus-eee-1000h.snapshot.11.yaml) and to automatically predict them.
